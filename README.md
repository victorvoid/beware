There are many reasons why you might lose your Internet connection. **BEWARE**, if your SPA/APP does not working because of the internet connection, is better notify the user about it.

The battery status also is better notify, it improve the user experience, because sometimes he is so focused that he can't even remind when the battery is running low.
